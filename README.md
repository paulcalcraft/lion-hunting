# GUI application for evolving lion hunting behaviour (computer modelling)
A multi-threaded windows GUI application for visualising and evolving lion hunting behaviour using genetic algorithms.

![Two lions are shown chasing a gazelle, using an evolved strategy.](/demo-images/simulation_eg.png?raw=true)
Two lions (orange) are shown chasing (see line trails) a gazelle (yellow), using an evolved strategy.

Evolution of behaviour and simulation visualisation can occur simultaneously, using multi-threading.

As new generations are evolved, the table of results (left) fills with key statistics, and each simulation run can be viewed on the right by choosing it from the table. Playback speed can be adjusted, and simulation screenshots can be taken from the GUI in the bottom right.
